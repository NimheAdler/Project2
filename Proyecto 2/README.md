# Project 2

## Contents

This project contains some examples of funcionality developed with **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**.

There are 3 main sections developed in this practice, wich are:

> A dinamic **Navigation bar** In wich the user can select the section wanted and it gets to it scrolling smoothly.

> A clear **Section active state**  making it easy to view in wich section we are while scrolling through the page.

> A button that appears at the bottom right corner of the web when we scroll down to help the user to go back top.

## Usage
